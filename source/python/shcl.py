"""SHCL binding for Python: parser, accessor, writer/formatter.

Single file on purpose - the drop-in story is "copy this file into your tree".
Behavior tracks the Rust reference (source/rust/src/lib.rs) byte for byte; the
conformance corpus in project/conformance/ pins every behavior here, and the
cicd cross-binding check compares this against the reference on every run.
Structure deliberately mirrors the reference over Python idiom, so a fix there
ports here by mechanical diff (parity over idiom - see style-guide.md).
"""

# The type gate, turned on here rather than left at its default: without this the
# checker skips every unannotated body, which in a module with no annotations is
# the whole file - a gate that cannot fail. `assignment` stays off because the
# structures mirrored from the reference are tagged tuples and index-or-None
# locals, which read as type changes to a checker and are not; everything that
# catches a real misuse (a None reaching an operator, a wrong argument, a bad
# return) is live.
