##	Purpose:
##		Measure SHCL against JSON, YAML, TOML and XML on documents that hold the
##		same data in each format, at a size where parser behavior actually shows.
##		The README makes claims about how SHCL compares; this is where the
##		numbers behind them come from, and rerunning it is how they stay honest.
##
##		The comparison holds the language constant within a tier, so every format
##		is read by a library from the same ecosystem, built the same way. The
##		Rust tier is the headline; the Python tier repeats it over the same
##		documents to separate what a format costs from what one implementation
##		of it costs. Python libraries that are not installed are skipped and
##		named, never fatal - only python3 itself is needed.
##
##		Detailed results accumulate in results.shcl - written, pruned and read
##		back through this repo's own library, which is both the storage format
##		and the point.
##
##		Run on demand, never as a pipeline stage: benchmarks are noisy and slow,
##		and a red build caused by a busy machine teaches nobody anything. The
##		Rust crate beside this script is the only thing in the repo with
##		third-party dependencies, and it stays out of the gate for that reason
##		too - the gate must not need crates.io to pass.
##	Syntax:
##		compare.bash [--no-build] [tool options...]
##		  --no-build   use the binary already built
##		  --help       full option list from the tool itself
##	Exit: 0 = every measurement completed, 1 = one or more failed.
##	History: At bottom of script.
